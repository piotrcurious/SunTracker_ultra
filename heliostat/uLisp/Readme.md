Replacing trigonometry with algebraic geometry for numerical stability and elegance in the uLisp heliostat control system involves leveraging vector operations and intrinsic properties of geometric shapes (e.g., dot products and cross products). Here's the improved uLisp code:

Improvements:

1. Vector and Field Abstractions:

Encapsulation of vector operations (dot, cross, normalize) to ensure clean, reusable code.

Avoid explicit use of trigonometric functions by using algebraic relationships.



2. Angle Calculations via Dot Products:

The angle between two vectors can be computed using the dot product:




\cos(\theta) = \frac{\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{B}}{\|\textbf{A}\| \|\textbf{B}\|}

3. Plane Projection for Mirror Normal:

Use cross products to compute orthogonal vectors and ensure proper plane alignment.







Key Features:

1. Algebraic Geometry:

Uses vector operations (dot, cross) to calculate angles and normal vectors.

Eliminates explicit trigonometric function calls (e.g., atan2, asin) for numerical stability.



2. Reusability:

Encapsulation of vector operations allows easy extension or reuse in other geometric computations.



3. Precision:

Normalized vectors and magnitude calculations ensure the heliostat remains stable in edge cases.



4. Efficiency:

Simplifies calculations by leveraging algebraic relationships instead of expensive trigonometric functions.




This implementation provides a robust and numerically stable heliostat control system using the power of algebraic geometry.
