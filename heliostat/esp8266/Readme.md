To improve the code using algebraic geometry and leverage the inherent fields of the number types (e.g., vectors and their algebraic operations), we can use vectors to define the geometry of the heliostat system. Instead of relying on trigonometric functions explicitly, we can operate directly on the vectors to compute reflection properties.

Hereâ€™s the improved version of the heliostat code:

Key Improvements:

1. Algebraic Vector Operations: Vector addition, subtraction, normalization, and dot product are used to calculate the reflection direction.


2. No Trigonometric Functions: Angles are derived from the geometry of the vectors.


3. Custom Vector Type: Encapsulates the operations, improving clarity and modularity.



Improvements Explained:

1. Vector Calculations: Instead of converting to and from angles using trigonometric functions, we operate directly on vectors. The sun's position and target are represented as vectors in 3D space.


2. Normalization and Projection: The Vector type provides algebraic operations like addition, normalization, and dot product, which help compute the necessary directions.


3. Reflection Geometry: The mirror normal is computed as the average of the sun's direction and the target vector. This aligns the mirror to reflect light accurately.


4. Code Modularity: The Vector structure encapsulates all vector operations, improving clarity and reusability.



This version uses algebraic geometry principles and avoids direct reliance on trigonometric calculations, making it mathematically elegant and computationally efficient.
