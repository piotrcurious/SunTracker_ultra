Further improving the code, we can incorporate advanced mathematical techniques, modularity, and extensibility while maintaining the numerical stability introduced earlier. The following enhancements focus on better encapsulation, improved efficiency, and advanced algebraic geometry concepts:


---

Key Improvements:

1. Generalized Algebraic Operations:

Encapsulate mathematical structures (Field, Vector, etc.) in a reusable library-like design.

Ensure operations are mathematically rigorous (e.g., modular arithmetic with proper handling of inverses and normalization).



2. Separation of Concerns:

Move hardware-specific functionality (e.g., stepper control, end-stop handling) into separate classes/modules.

Keep the heliostat logic focused on mathematical computations.



3. Improved Efficiency:

Precompute expensive operations (e.g., trigonometric functions) where possible.

Use compact data structures and optimize algorithms.



4. Advanced Coordinate Transformations:

Incorporate more advanced geometric techniques, such as dual-quaternions or affine transformations, to calculate angles and normalize vectors.







Key Features of the Improvements:

1. Modular Design:

StepperController abstracts stepper motor operations.

Heliostat encapsulates all heliostat-related logic.



2. Advanced Algebraic Geometry:

Continued use of modular arithmetic (Field) and normalized vector calculations.

Improved numerical stability through encapsulation and abstraction.



3. Separation of Concerns:

Clear separation between hardware-specific logic and mathematical computations.

Easier to extend or debug individual components.



4. Improved Readability and Extensibility:

Code is organized into reusable components.

Future enhancements (e.g., support for additional degrees of freedom) can be added with minimal changes.



5. Efficiency:

Optimized angle calculations.

Reduced complexity in the heliostat logic.




This version improves precision, modularity, and maintainability, making it ideal for long-term projects or integration into more complex systems.
