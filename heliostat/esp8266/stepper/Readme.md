Here’s a revised version of the heliostat code that uses stepper motors instead of servos. The system resets to the zero position using end stops at startup, and acceleration is implemented to smoothly ramp up and decelerate movements.

Key Changes:

1. Stepper Motor Control: Uses the AccelStepper library for precise control with acceleration and deceleration.


2. End Stops: Configurable end stops ensure the system resets to the zero position at startup.


3. Acceleration/Deceleration: The AccelStepper library handles acceleration profiles.






Key Features:

1. Stepper Motor Control:

AccelStepper library enables precise movement with acceleration and deceleration.



2. End Stop Reset:

During initialization, the motors move until the end stops are triggered, ensuring a known starting position.



3. Smooth Movements:

Acceleration and deceleration are configured to avoid jerky motions.



4. Angle-to-Steps Conversion:

Calculates the required number of steps based on the target angle and the motor’s step resolution.

Benefits:

Smooth Operation: Acceleration profiles prevent wear on mechanical components.

Accuracy: Direct calculation of steps ensures precise positioning.

Modularity: Easy to adapt for different stepper configurations or resolutions.


This setup is ideal for systems requiring precise and smooth heliostat control.
